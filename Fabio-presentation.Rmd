- Technical and economic criteria alone do not (yet) allow for informed decisions. 


- Where is the environment in the techno-centrical approaches?

-  The root of the plastic waste problem needs to be addressed: the extraction and production.
-  Responsibility to act in the plastics economy

- **Adaptive injustice**: *those who find ways to adapt to changing social realities, whether forced or voluntary, are not those who are responsible for the negative changes to which they are adapting. Specifically, it is an adaptive injustice to expect communities to figure out what to do with continual flow of plastics into the economy.*
