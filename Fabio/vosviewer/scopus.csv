Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology. FGF could be a key driver to promote further greening of distributed recycling thanks to the reduced melt solidification steps and elimination of the filament extruder system. However, only large-scale FGF systems have been tested for technical and economic viability of recycling plastic materials. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: Commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 /kg compared with more than 20 /kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality. This indicates the possibility of a new type of 3D printing recycled plastic waste that is more likely to drive a circular economy and distributed recycling. © Alexandre et al. 2020; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2020.","Distributed recycling; Fused granular fabrication; Polylactic acid; Recycling; Tensile properties","Cost reduction; Extruders; Fabrication; Large scale systems; Mechanical properties; Pelletizing; Plastic recycling; Polyesters; Printing presses; Economic viability; Melt solidification; Plastic materials; Recycled plastics; Reproducibilities; Statistical differences; Technical quality; Threedimensional (3-d); 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089810706

This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy. © 2020 The Authors","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Circular economy; Distributed recycling; Plastic recycling","Additives; Environmental impact; Plastic recycling; 3D printing process; Additive manufacturing technology; Economic viability; Mechanical recycling; Potential researches; Systematic literature review; Technical evolution; Technical potential; 3D printers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083723147

Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of “smart grid”, composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Circular economy; Closed loop supply chain; Distributed recycling; Mixed integer linear programming; Plastic recycling","3D printers; Integer programming; Open source software; Plastic filaments; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; 3-D printing; Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Economic and environmental benefits; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Plastic recycling; environmental economics; feasibility study; linear programing; logistics; optimization; plastic waste; recycling; supply chain management; article; economic aspect; feasibility study; France; high school; plastic waste; recycling; sensitivity analysis; system analysis; three dimensional printing; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075796783

In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Mechanical properties; Open source additive manufacturing; PLA; Plastic recycling; RepRap","Additives; Feedstocks; Mechanical properties; Plastic recycling; Polymers; Printing machinery; Recycling; Reinforced plastics; 3-D printing; General methodologies; Open sources; Physico-chemicals; Polymer processing; Recycling process; RepRap; Thermoplastic materials; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027687467
